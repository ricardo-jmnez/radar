Radio-detection and ranging, widely known as *radar*, is one of the most outstanding developments of applied physics in the 20th century. Of the many radar techniques, *frequency-modulated continous-wave* (FMCW) radar is of particular interest in the rapidly evolving fields of self-driving vehicles, advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), and contactless computer-human interfaces, to name but a few of the tons of applications of the technique. 

The purpose of this brief tutorial is to introduce the basics of the technique, terminology, and design parameters, with a focus on signal processing. The tutorial does not cover details related with hardware implementation nor with the important aspect of signal-to-noise ratio and detection theory.
